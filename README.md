# ADHDSib_CWAS_NBS
This is the repository to share some files we used for analyses of the manuscript "Compensatory functional segregation related to the salience network in unaffected siblings of youths with ADHD".
The files includes the nifti file of the group-wise gray matter mask and the covariates used for the Connectome-wide Association Study and the Network-based Statistic. 
The order of the covariates is: diagnostic group, sex, age linear term, age squared term, full-scale IQ, mean of framewise displacement, and comorbidity status (categorical). Besides these covariates, for the proband-sibling comparison ("ADHD_UnSib_Cov_meancentered.txt"), we also included a covariate that encoded family membership. All these nuisance dimensional variables were mean-centered across all participants prior to model fitting.
